## Machine Learning Iris Classification Task using Python

To get started on machine learning without getting overwhelmed, I'm going to begin by stepping through one of the simplest datasets out there: the Iris flower dataset. 

First, I'll explore the basics of the data, then I'll make a few different plots to see what patterns are revealed. 

Next I'll test some ready-made algorithms and choose the one with the best result to create a machine learning model. 

This model should be able to classify the iris flowers based on data about their dimensions.
